# Gym Management System (Android application - Kotlin)
Gym Management System is an android application built using Kotlin, SQLite. 
The application lets the managerial staff of the gym take up admin roles on the app and provide them with features with which they can perform add/read/update/delete (perform CRUD operations) member details.

For other users (members) of the gym, the app would be able to act as a catalog of membership plans to them and give them payment reminders along with payment receipts.
